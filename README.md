# Description
The main objective of this project is to analyze the success and dynamics of the popularity of music and artists mainly in Colombia, considering factors such as time in the industry, number of releases, popularity, genre, etc. Due to the above, emphasis is placed on answering the following questions:
1) How long does it take for a raggaeton artist in Puerto Rico to become recognized in relation to Colombia and what factors influence this?
2) What is the average time it takes for a reggaeton artist in Colombia to reach 1 million monthly streams, compared to other musical genres?
3) How does the impact of a collaboration (remix) between artists depending on musical genre and geographic region?
4) How does an artist's release frequency affect their long-term popularity?
